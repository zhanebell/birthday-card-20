Your task:
You will be creating a github repository, which will host
a static webpage through GitHub for the following concept:

You will make a cute virtual Birthday Card for my girlfriend.
You will adhere to the content and styling guidelines provided.
You will create an aesthetic HTML, JS, CSS structured website.

My girlfriend is always making me cool handmade cards with
interactive components, images, cute tiny details, notes,
images, colors, secret compartments, etc.

My goal is to create for her a nice virtual card that has all 
of these traits. The user (my girlfriend) will be able to open the card, and reveal
all the hidden flaps by dragging and clicking.

As she interacts, the card "unfolds" into layered scenes like a pop up book,
revealing notes, photos, and mini-surprises. This card features
beautiful animations and nice easter eggs. 

The vibe is warm, aesthetic, handmade textures, paper edges, soft shadows,
beige and other neutral colors, with sage green accents in a cursive font.

Goal: celebrate her 20th birthday with moments that feel discovered, not
dumped--short notes, unlockable compartments. Unfortunately, we can't do photos
for this card, as that would involve uploading photos of us publicly. But we can use
other forms of images and visuals. 

Loose flow:
Cover View — A closed card with a wax‑seal–style badge: “Open Me, Birthday Girl.”

Unfold Animation — Hinge‑flip into Inside Spread; confetti sparks and a short greeting animates in.

Interactive Hunt — She notices tiny cues (ribbons, tabs, cut‑outs). Each reveals a compartment with a themed surprise.

Crescendo — After opening N compartments, a Center Pop‑Up rises (a 3D layer) with the main birthday message.

Finale - the final Birthday message shows up, and there is a letter
for her to read. For now, can you make the letter and I will edit it later on to be personalized.

Pull‑Tabs: Drag to reveal a hidden strip of text (reason, memory, or mini‑coupon). Resistance animation for tactile feel.

Flip Panels: Paper doors with tiny latch icons that flip to reveal a note or photo.

Accordion Pocket: Expands to show 3–5 mini Polaroid frames (photos or illustrations) with captions.

Secret Die‑Cut: Hover/tap a silhouette cut‑out (e.g., heart) to peek a message; click to fully reveal.

Scratch‑Off Layer: A foil overlay you rub (cursor/touch) to reveal a surprise.

Magnet Lock: Two paper magnets snap together; drag apart to open a compartment.

Spiral Notebook Tear‑Out: Click to “tear” a perforated note (cute sound) that floats into a keepsake pile.

Ribbon Untie: Click‑and‑hold to untie a bow (progress ring) and open a big compartment.

Slider Puzzle (Tiny): Solve a 3‑tile slider; completing reveals a special date or inside joke.

Envelope Insert: A small envelope opens to reveal a custom link (playlist, shared album, future date night form).

Additionally, somewher ein this app, I would like there to be a 
"20 things" button. If you spin it, it will give her a list of 20 ___.
I want one for 20 reasons I love you. 20 things I look forward to in our future.
20 dates that I want to go on with you. I will spin some sort of wheel, which will finish the phrase "20 ... __" and then 
there will be an animation of the 20 things fading in and out for her to read at a good pace.

Materials: Paper textures, letterpress shadows, tiny ink imperfections, washi‑tape corners.

Typography: Handwritten‑feel display for headers + clean sans for body; oversized numbers “20”.

Motion Principles: Springy, low‑amplitude; 200–450ms transitions; staggered reveals; parallax on card layers.
